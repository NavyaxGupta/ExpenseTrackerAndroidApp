WHAT THIS APP DOES:
This app helps users track their expenses.
The user can categorize their expenses into self-made categories like food, rent, gym, loans, beauty, etc.
The system displays total expenses and their categories.
The app also gives users the option to receive alerts if their set budget is crossed.

MY JOURNEY:
I wanted to develop a fully interactive app using my coding skills. 
During my undergraduate classes, I wrote complex code related to data management and games. However, those applications only ran through the terminal. 
I became curious about how I could apply that code to create a user-interactive app.

Initially, I wrote the backend code for this app in Python. 
However, when I discovered Android Studio, I decided to convert it to Java. 
At first, I had no idea what Android Studio was, but after learning about its functionality and popularity, I made the decision to use it for my project.

Throughout this process, I gained knowledge in Kotlin, XML, and Android Studio. 
I also utilized my existing Java skills and Python to enhance those skills further.
Overall, working with this software has increased my confidence and expanded my skill set.

MY CODE:
My Java class and Kotlin files are at app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication.
My XML files are at app/src/main/res/layout.

SCREENSHOTS:
